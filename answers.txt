2 (f) "Explain your tokenizer function and discuss its performance."
There are three stages in my tokeniser function.

First, all mentions of the names of 'safe seats' for each party are replaced by a token (or, more accurately, what will become a token) indicating a reference to that party's safe seat. For example, "Kingston and Surbiton" is replaced by "LiberalDemocratSAFESEAT". To determine which constituencies are safe seats, for convenience I used the Hansard dataset itself, extracting those constituencies only associated with a single party, but in principle this information could be obtained from an external source instead. There are two main reasons why a constituency name would appear in an MP's speech. The first is that they are talking about something in their local area, and so mentioning a party's safe seat would be a good indicator that the speaker is a member of that party. However, the other is to refer to other MPs, as they are not allowed to refer to each other by name in the House of Commons and will instead often refer to a particular MP by the constituency they represent. So naming a safe seat could also indicate that the speaker is referring to an MP of that party. Either way, in a party-political context I conjecture that the most relevant part of the 'meaning' of constituency names, at least for safe seats, is what party they are represented by, hence this substitution.

Next, the text is split into words by taking any sequence of non-alphanumeric characters other than apostrophes and hyphens to be a separator, and normalised into lower case. 

Finally, '_NOT' is appended to each token that occurs between any of a pre-defined set of 'negative words' and punctuation (which for this purpose is taken to be any non-space separator between words). The negative words are slightly more broad than is standard, including not only words like 'not' and 'isn't' but also some words expressing negative valence such as 'bad' or 'incompetent'. The idea here is to capture whether certain concepts are being talked about in a positive or negative context. For example, it would be expected that the governing party (which was the Conservatives in the period that the dataset covers) would talk positively about the state of the economy, health service, etc., whilest the opposition parties would be expected to mention these in more negative contexts.
